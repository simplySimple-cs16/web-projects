SECTION 4: Introduction to CSS
  **Project 1 Continued
    - Inline css : css code within [the same html file : INCORRECT] a tag i.e as an attribute to an HTML element
    - https://colorhunt.co/ : Color Palettes for Designers and Artists
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value : color hex values and their names
    - Internal CSS : css code within the head section of the HTML file and applies for selected tags
    - overriding default browser css value for hr
    - External CSS : css code lies in another file than the html file
    - link for linking stylesheet
    - CSS types priority :
        -first: Inline
        -second: Internal
        -third: External
    - CSS sytax:
        selector{proerty:value;}
    - advisable to list css proerties in alphabetical order so that the debugging process is easier
    - css selectors in order of increasing priority:
        -element selector: for eg h1,h2{}
        -class selector: .className{}
            -a html tag can have more than one class.
                eg: <img class="a b" src=""/>
            -more than one html tag can have the same class name.
                eg: <h1 class="a"> hi </h1>
                    <h3 class="a"> hi </h3>
        -id selector: #idName{}
            -a html tag cannot have more than one id.
            -a id name can be used only once
        -pseudo class selector:
            -detect changes in HTML state and apply css properties accordingly. For eg. the state of being hovered or not
            -eg:
              img:hover{
                background-color:red;
              }
              -change the color of image to red when hovered
      - https://www.favicon.cc/ : for creating fav icons
  **Project 2 : CSS - My Site
    - HTML div for dividing HTML ELEMENT into sections
    - box model : border, margin and padding concept
    - border : solid 10px; //shortcut for specicifying border type and size
    - CSS diaplay properties:
        -block
          -block element takes up the whole WIDTH of the screen
          -block elements: h1,p
          -width can be changed.
        -Inline
          -take up width only to the size of the element.
          -Inline elements : span,<a>
          CAN't change the width.
        -inline-block
          -best of both worlds
          -element are on the same line and thier width can be changed too.
          - eg : <img>
        -none
          - make the element disappear.
          - helps in hiding things
          - same thing can be achieved by visibility: ; property
    - block can be change to inline and vice-versa using css display: ; property
    - <span> : for sections within an HTML ELEMENT. It's an inline display element.
    - CSS positioning:
        -content is everything: height of box is that always of the content.Width of box may not be same i.e block or inline
        -HTML code determines the order of things displayed
        -children sit on top of parent:
          eg. <div>
                <h1> I am <span>Kadum Perme</span> </h1>
              <div>
              on screen, first div will be rendered, than h1 and than span.
